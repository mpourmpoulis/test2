# Exercise Three

our approach is going to be similar to the one in the first exercise. Because we must open chocolate boxes in strictly ascending order, our path in class the time needed are strictly determined simply by the boxes we wish to choose.

As a first step, we sort all chocolate boxes based on the number of chocolates they have in ascending order. the operation consumes O(nlogn) time. In case of ties, we don't really care which one comes first, as we can never open to chocolate boxes with the same number of chocolates regardless of whether they are of the same type or not.

We now define the following function :

dp(i,q)= minimum time in order to cause you at least q chocolates , with i-th box being the last to open

The solution to our problem is going to be 

Minimum{1<=i<=n}(dp(i,Q))

It holds :

```
dp(i,q)= minimum{
	minimum{1<=j<i, q_j<q_i, t_j =/= t_i>} (dp(j,max(0,q-q_i)) + distance(i,j)) ,
	distance(i,p) if q_i>=q,
	dp(i,q+1)
}
```

these dynamic programming problem can be solved in O(Q*n^2) time and in O(Q*n) space.



# Exercise Four

Essentially we are dealing with a language edit distance problem. This language is produced by the following context free grammar:

S -> N|S OP S| '(' S ')'
N -> natural number
OP ->one of the +,-,*,/ operators 

we are going to approach this problem with his thunder CYK dynamic programming algorithm. To do that the first we convert the grammar to see CNF form:

```
INITIAL -> EXPRESSION

EXPRESSION -> N | EXPRESSION OPERATOR_FOLLOWED_BY_EXPRESSION | STARTING_PARENTHESES EXPRESSION_FOLLOWED_BY_CLOSING_PARENTHESES


OPERATOR_FOLLOWED_BY_EXPRESSION -> OP EXPRESSION 
EXPRESSION_FOLLOWED_BY_CLOSING_PARENTHESES -> EXPRESSION CLOSING_PARENTHESES


STARTING_PARENTHESES -> (
CLOSING_PARENTHESES  -> )
OP -> op one of the +,-,*,/ operators 
N -> number
```

please note that regarding the timing of symbol "number" we first tokenize all the digits appearing in our string, sought for instance 0345 becomes two tokens 0  and 345 and we assign each token and and weight proportional to the number of characters in it (that is one and three respectively).

we also enumerate our non-terminal symbols
```
0 INITIAL
1 EXPRESSION
2 OPERATOR_FOLLOWED_BY_EXPRESSION
3 EXPRESSION_FOLLOWED_BY_CLOSING_PARENTHESES
4 STARTING_PARENTHESES
5 CLOSING_PARENTHESES
6 OP
7 N
```



we consider the function

* dp(i,j,r) = meeting will edit distance to transform the interval (i,j) so that it correspondence to the r-th non-terminal symbol

our problem is to compute dp(1,n,0). Now it holds:

```
dp(i,j,r) =  minimum(
		minimum{for production rule r -> a b}(
			minimum(
				minimum{for x in [i,j)}(
						dp(i,x,r) + dp(x + 1,j,b)
				),
				dp(i,j,a) + full_cost(b),
				dp(i,j,b) + full_cost(a),
			)
		),
		if i == j (
			if exists r -> symbol[i]: 0
			else minimum(weight[i],full_cost(r))
		)
		,
		if i != j (
			minimum(
				minimum{k:exists r -> symbol[k]}(total_weight(i,j)-weight[k]),
				minimum(
					total_weight(i,j),
					minimum{g:exists r -> g}(weight(g))
				)
			)
		)
)
```

these dynamic programming problem can be solved in O(n^3)
