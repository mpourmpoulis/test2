# Exercise Set 4

ΚΙΤΣΙΟΣ ΠΑΝΑΓΙΩΤΗΣ 03116007

## Exercise One

We are going to denote with `d_1,d_2,...,d_N` the given numbers. 


To verify that the given numbers are the actual shortest path decencies we propose the following criteria

for every vertex u must hold

```python
d_u = min{(v,u) belongs to E}(d_v + w(v,u))
```

As we work with every edge just once, our algorithm can run in `O(|E|)` which is of course linear!

To prove that these criterion works we must show:

- the actual shortest paths must satisfy it

- If some numbers satisfy it, they must be the shortest path distances!


the first of those two follows directly from the optimality principle in combination with the fact that any path from the origin to a given node, must go through an node that has an outgoing edge towards it!


With all of the above settle down, we should also note that we can obtain a shortest path rate in linear time by simply finding for each node u the node v

```python
argmin{(v,u) belongs to E}(d_v + w(v,u))
```

and work backwards!

(incomplete)

### Updating Decreasing Weight


When we are decreasing the weight of an edge w(u,v), this might have the consequence that 

- some path was going through these edge, so it's weight needs to be reduced

- new shortest paths are created that utilize this edge. That means that the foregoing from s to t, we need to check if the path `s > u > v > t` is better than the currently used one!

Take into account that pair of nodes for which the path cannot contain the edge must remain unchanged(!), both of these cases are handled by the below formula

```python
d_new(s,t) = min(d_old(s,t),d_old(s,u) + w_new(u,v) + d_old(v,t))
```

Every update can be done in  constant time so computing these for every pair of nodes is supposedly quadratic `O(n**2)`


### Updating When Increasing Weight

in contrast to before, when we are increasing their weight of an edge, we are facing the much harder problem of potentially having to remove  all paths that go through it, instead of creating new paths and comparing them with the old ones! this is much more challenging because we might have to reroute all the paths that utilize it!




## Exercise two

we are asked to determine whether a system of linear inequalities

```python
Ax<=b
```

Of the form `x_i - x_j <= b_i_j` is feasible or not. 

Now these inequalities look notoriously like the ones we see in problems regarding shortest paths

```python
d(v)<=d(u) + w(u,v) for every (u,v) in E
```

in fact E from the given system we construct a directed graph with many vertices as variables in the system of inequalities and where each right side of the inequality `b_i_j`  corresponds to their weight over the niche going from j to i, we can even formulate the problem of finding the shortest path between any two nodes as follows

```python
maximize x_t - x_s subject to
Ax<=b
```

So if we can find the shortest path for one pair of nodes in our graph then that means that the system of inequalities is feasible! 

on the reverse side, given that unless a pair of nodes does not have a path that connects them, our leading or integer program cannot be unbounded, the feasibility of the original inequality system implies there is an optimal solution and shortest paths can be defined!


so checking the shortest paths can be defined solvers our problem, so we only need to check if there are no negative cycles in the graph because then there is no meaning in talking about shortest paths! 

### Part Two

As we already said earlier, finding a feasible solution ( in case there is one and not just determining whether it exists)  is something that can be accomplished by the Belmont Ford algorithm! On the other side, we notice that an infeasible subset is going to correspond to a negative cycle with as mane edges as there are inequalities in the subset, so if we can find the smallest negative cycle in the graph, then we are done. 



The very nature of this algorithm to construct the shortest path with utmost i edges at i-th iteration, also gives us inspiration about how to find smallest subset of the original system that is infeasible. consider for a moment thought all negative cycles begin from our origin, then if we could check at the end of every iteration whether a negative cycle exists instead of just at the end, then we could simply stop the first time we one, because all other cycles require more iterations to  be constructed and are consequently at least as long! to lift the requirement that the baths must begin at our origin, we can extend this idea and modify the Floyd Ward algorithm instead! the total time complexity will however be cubic `O(|V|**3)`



## Exercise Three - Electric Car

### First Case

Essentially our task camps down to determining the city c belonging to C-{s,t} that maximizes the quantity

```
d(s,c) + d(c,t)
```

we can computer the first term for every city with air refueling station( along with his shortest path that actually leads there) in a single go using Dijsktra's algorithm originating from s. In a similar manner, we can also compute the second term FaceTime starting from the destination city t and working on the same graph but with all of its edges a reversed! using the Fibonacci heap, each of the two rounds for the shortest baths will run in `O(|E| + |V|log|V|)`

### Second Case

Suppose we somehow know the the shortest path between any two refueling points ( as well as the baths to and from the origin and the destination). then our task simply comes down to specifying which refueling stations and in what order we are going to make a stop at, as in order to maintain optimality we must use the shortest path between any two subsequent endpoints so the rest of our route can be determined from the refueling sequence! so we must find a sequence

```python
[c1,c2,...,cK] 
```

but the maximizing the quantity

```python
d(s,c1) + d(c1,c2) + d(c2,c3) + ... + d(cK,t)
```

While being subject to the condition that any of the terms must be less than our fuel capacity `a`

these we can easily achieve the following way:

- Construct a second graph, but the contains as vertices only the refueling cities ( along with the origin and the destination)

- if a shortest path exists in the original graph between two nodes from   x to y with weight `w<=a`, we connect those two nodes on the second graph with an edge with weight w

- we then run the shortest path algorithm once again to find the shortest path from the origin s to the destination t


please note that in the above discussion, if the shortest path going from one refueling station c1 to another c2 goes through c3 then there is no problem at all!

The graph construction costs `O(|V|**2)` in the shortest paths of the cost of `O(|E| + |V|log|V|)`. Nonetheless they are both overshadowed by the initial cost of computing all to all shortest paths in the original graph which can be accomplished by the Floyd Warshall algorithm which requires cubic time `O(|V|**3)` which is our final complexity!









## Exercise Five - Reductions

### Three Partition

firstly we can clearly see that this problem lies in NP, with the various subsets being certificate( in linear time was simply sum up all of their elements and see if they're all equal)

To prove and be hardness we are going to perform a reduction from two partition problem.

In particular, if were given the set X = {x1,x2,...,xN} our task is to determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets with the same sum.

We consider the following reduction, we compute

`s = x1 + x2 + ... + xN` 

and we created a set 

`Y = {x1,x2,...,xN,s/2}` 

And so the three partition problem on Y 

now we can clearly see that if the answer to the two partition problem is yes, so we can partition X into W,Z each with sum `s/2` , then we can also partition Y into W,Z,{s/2}!

On the reverse side, if we can partition Y into W,Z,T, because the total sum of Y  is `3*s/2` it must hold T = {s/2}, so we can partition X into W,Z!

So the answer to the reduced problem is the same as their want for the original one! please note that the in the above analysis we are assuming that the total sum is an even number, because otherwise the answer to the two partition problem is trivial( of course false!)




### Longest Path

It is trivial to see that this problem is part of NP with the certificate being simply the path itself!
Now to show that it is also NP hard, we are going to recuse Hamiltonian path to our problem.

Consider a graph G with n = |V| vertices. we can build in polynomial time a second graph G2 which contains all edges and vertices of the original graph and also contains for every vertex v that graph an additional vertex u that is connected only with v and thus has a cardinality/degree of one! now we ask our selfs the question what is going to be the longest path in the second graph?

Because any of thing usually added vertices has a degree of one, they can only appear at the beginning or at the end of some path. As a consequence, the longest path can only contain up to two of them and the rest must stem from the original graphand in fact because for any two path endpoints (v1,v2) there are newly added vertices (u1,u2) , the longest path in the graph G2 is going to be the longest path of the original graph with the addition of the newly added u vertices!  it clearly follows that if the length of the original longest path was p, New longest path will be p + 2.


With that in mind, we can clearly see the Hamiltonian path exists in the original graph if and only if the longest path in the second graph has a length of n + 2! (as only Hamiltonian path in the original graph can have a length of  n)

So we have managed to link the two problems, but to achieve all result of deciding whether a path exists with more than 1/4 of the vertices, we want one adjustment. we are not going to add just one extra vertex for every vertex in the original graph to obtain a graph with 2n vertices. Instead we're going to add more nodes in a manner_similar_to_the_above so the final graph has a total off `4n + 8` ! ( the last 8 we do not really care about where we put them)


This transformation still remains polynomial, and if our algorithm for deciding whether there exists a bath with a length of at least 1/4 of the vertices returns true, then the longest path is guaranteed to contain at least `(4n + 8)/4 = n + 2` vertices and as a consequence the answer to the question whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the original graph is also true. On the contrary if the answer is false, then so is the answer to the original problem!


As a consequence we are able to reduce an NP complete problem, namely Hamiltonian path to the longest path problem, so it must also be NP hard.


### Dense Subgraph

This problem clearly lies in NP in the certificate is obviously the set  S! ( indeed if we were given the set of vertices is trivial to compute in linear time how many ages there are). as a consequence we only need to show and NP  hardto prove NP completeness!

but NP hardness follows directly on this problem is in the the generalization of the clique problem. if you are given a graph G and a number K you can decide if there is a click of size K by simply solving the dense subgraph problem using the same graph G and K, and setting `B = (k*(k-1))/2`! this simple reduction can be obviously performed in polynomial time, and as a consequence our problem is NP hard!








### Independent Set Selection

firstly we are going to show that these problem belongs to NP in the certificate is the selected subsets themselves. Indeed we can verify a solution simply by

- check that there are  k subsets in it

- Check that no two sets of any element in common, which would be true if and only if no element appears devise a nor given subsets! these of course can be verified in linear time O(n) as we simply 

	- initially Mark all elements of the universe U as unvisited 

	- we go through every element of every subset one by one  and if not already visited we mark them visited. Otherwise we return false!

	- If we are done with the above step, then it means that no element appears twice in downsides we can return true! because of the pigeon hole principal, by the time we reached this step we cannot help you formed more than n iterations, as otherwise we would have found an element twice!


To prove that it is also NP hard (and as such complete), we are going to utilize a reduction on from independent set. The problem can be formulated as follows

Given a graph G(V,E) and a lower bound K,  does G contain an independent set( that is set in which no two vertices are connected by an edge) of cardinality k?


The two problems look very close to one another in fact reduction is pretty simple!

we simply set the universe `U = E`

and `S = {{all ages in E that have v as endpoint} for v in V}`

and `k = k`

as we can see the two vertices in the original graph are not connected by an edge if and only if their correspondence sets in our reduced instance are disjoint, it follows that the answer to the independent set problem is yes if and only if the answer to our transformed problem is also yes! and because this reduction can be all beautifully done in polynomial time and the independent set problem is NP hard, so must be our given one!
